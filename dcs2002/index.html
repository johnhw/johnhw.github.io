We are considering organising a reunion to celebrate this milestone and to catch up with old friends and indeed long-forgotten classmates. This is a placeholder to gauge interest in such an event. If you are a member of the class of 2002, please fill in the form below to let us know if you would be interested in attending a reunion in Summer 2027.

**Please pass this on to anyone you know who was in the class of 2002.** We are trying to reach as many people as possible, but we don't have contact details for very many people yet.
