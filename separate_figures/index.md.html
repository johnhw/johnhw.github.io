# Separating figures from a LaTeX document

Some academic journals, like [PLoS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures), require that you submit a final document as a single self-contained LaTeX file, and all figures need to be submitted as separate image files, with any figures having multiple panels merged into a single image.

If you have a paper with a lot of `\include`s and figures, this is a pain to do by hand. It is possible to do this automatically.

## Merging the file into one `.tex` file

To make sure the bibliography is included in the source, change your source to replace `\bibliography{...}` with 
`\input{paper.bbl}`.

Then:

```
latex paper.tex
bibtex paper.tex
```  

to generate `paper.bbl`. 

Use [latexpand](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexpand?lang=en) to include all `\input{}` and `\include{}` files, as well as the bibliography into one file.

```
latexpand paper.tex > paper_merged.tex
```

* Windows users using MikTex will first need to [install Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/) to get `latexpand` to work.

## Separating the figures

The following is based on [this StackOverflow answer by John Kormylo](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/423109/export-each-figure-as-a-separate-pdf-file).

We can use the `endfloat` package to split out all floats into a separate file. In the preamble, just after `\documentclass`, add:

```latex
\usepackage{endfloat}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\makeatletter
\efloat@openpost{fff}
\efloat@iwrite{fff}{\string\textwidth=\the\textwidth}
\makeatother
```

Run `pdflatex paper_merged` and you will get a new file `paper_merged.fff` that has all the code for floating figures in it.

### The figure document
Create a new document `figures_separated.tex` with the following contents:

```latex
\documentclass[multi=figure]{standalone}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{amsmath} % packages I used in figures
\usepackage{subfig}

%% Include all custom macros used in figures here

\renewenvironment{figure}{\ignorespaces}{\unskip}
\renewcommand{\caption}[2][]{\ignorespaces}
\newcommand{\Figure}[1]{\ignorespaces}
\let\efloatseparator=\empty
\newcommand{\titlecaption}[2]{}
\begin{document}
\input{v2_paper.fff}
\end{document}
```

If you've used any custom macros or packages inside your floats, you'll need to include the relevant packages and add any of your own macros from `paper_merged.tex` into the preamble of `separated_figures.tex`.

Then:
```
pdflatex separated_figures.tex
```

to produce `separated_figures.pdf` which has each figure as a separate page.

#### Making TIFFs
PLoS One recommends all figures to be submitted as TIFF (unfortunately EPS is the only vector format PLoS support and it is not recommended...). [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) can convert this multi-page PDF to individual TIFF files in one go. 

* Create a directory called `output_images`

```
magick convert -density 700 -scene 1 -background white -alpha remove \ 
       -alpha off  separated_figures.pdf  "output_figures/fig%d.tiff"
```

* on Windows, use `%%d` instead of `%d` to avoid shell escaping

You should now have one TIFF file per figure, named `output_images/fig1.tiff` etc. You may need to adjust `density` if the images are too high or too low resolution -- `density 700` looked about right for my configuration.

That's it, you're done!
