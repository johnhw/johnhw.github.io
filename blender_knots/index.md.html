# ASCII knots to 3d renderings
![-](imgs/header.png width="60%")



Knots are a pain to model in 3D. I mean "knots"  as in the functional objects used to bind materials, like those [Ashley wrote about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashley_Book_of_Knots), rather than mathematical knots, for which there are [some nice tools available](https://knotplot.com/) to produce renderings. 

Such knots are also a pain to notate consistently in a form that can be shared over email or chat -- people often end up discussing knots in terms of their Ashley numbers (**ABOK #1010** is the Bowline, for example), which is fine if you (a) have a copy of the Ashley Book of Knots handy and (b) the knot is actually listed there. Many of the interesting knots noted at the [Notable Knot Index](https://notableknotindex.webs.com/), for example don't fall into that category. While the Notable Knot Index has nice illustrations, these are tricky to produce by hand and of course show only a single perspective on the construction.

I've devised a simple notation (knotation?) for representing basic knots, and a plugin for Blender that will parse this notation and generate 3D models automatically. It only generates a *starting point* for modelling,
with the correct topology and approximate geometry, but it is a useful helper.

## Some example renderings
![Examples of knots rendered from ASCII diagrams]("imgs/examples.png")


## Knotation:

The notation is a simple ASCII art representation of the path of the rope. The rope
can go in each of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), and can go beneath existing rope.

### Examples
It's easier to first see some examples in the notation:
 
#### Reef knot
```
                 +--+
        >--------|-----+                            
                 |  +----------<
                 |     |
                 |  +---------->
        <--------|-----+
                 +--+
                 
```                 
![]("imgs/reef.png" width="50%")

#### Figure of 8
```        
        
              +--+
              |  | 
        >-----|-----+
              |  |  |
              +--|----->
                 |  |
                 +--+

```
![]("imgs/fig8.png" width="50%")
                 
                 
#### Bowline
        
```        
              V
              |
              |
             /|-\
             \-\|
            /--||-\
            | \---/
            |  ||
            |  V|
            \---/
```

![]("imgs/bowline.png" width="50%")

### Leads
Every knot is represented as a collection of **leads**, where one a **lead** is a separate
piece of rope. A simple overhand knot only has one lead; a bend will have at least two leads, and so on.

* **lead** a connected sequence representing one physical strand of rope 
    * Every lead must have a **head**; either directed, undirected or numbered
    * A lead may have an explicit **tail** (ending marker), either directed or undirected but this is optional

* **space** any cell without any character

#### Lead characters
* `- |` connected elements of a **lead**, horizontal or vertical

```
        ---------


        |
        |
        |
        
```        
##### Under/over
A **lead** is assumed to continue underneath if it disappears without a corner symbol:
    
```    
        V                   V
        |                   |
    >---|---             >------
        |                   |
    
```

This may continue for any number of steps:

```    
         VVV
         |||
    >----|||----
         |||
         |||
                         
```

#### Corners
* `+` undirected corner

  Indicates a change of direction in a **lead**. Must be unambiguous when following the path of the **lead**
  

**OK**, unambiguous

```
      >----+
           |
           +----

                 |
       >--------++-<
                |
```

**NOT OK:** ambiguous

```
                  |
            >-----+
                  |

```                            

* `/ \` directed corner; Can be used to explicitly annotate direction of corner

```
                 |
                 |
        >--------/       >----\
                              |
                 
```        
### Heads/tails

* `^ v > <` Directed **head**

Indicates **head** of a **lead**, if facing a **lead** (i.e. *before* a `-` or `|`), or the **tail** if facing whitespace

```
        >---  [head]

        --->  [tail]

        V     [head and tail]
        |
        |
        V
```    

* `[0-9]` undirected **head**

Indicates start of a **lead**. Labels a lead with the given number. Only one digit permitted. Must neighbour exactly one **lead** cell so that direction is indicated.
```
        0---

        0
        |
        |
```        


* `.` Undirected tail (optional)

```
        ---.

        |
        |
        .
```

#### Comments/names

* `[name]` names a **lead**

May appear anywhere on the **lead** excluding the end, including before the **head** or in place of the **head**. Always read left to right, regardless of line orientation. The **lead** must pass through the name to take effect.  Can be used as a comment if not adjacent to a **lead**.

*The Blender script does not use the names for anything at the moment.*

```
    [a comment; this --- is ignored]
    
               V
               |
    [this has a lead through it and will name the lead]
               |
               .

```


```
    
            >[left]---> <---[right]<

            0
            |
            |
         [left]
            |
            |
            V

```

## Blender plugin
I have created a Blender plugin to create 3D meshes of knots from these ASCII art descriptions. This is a simple plugin,
which allows the creation of a knot mesh quickly. It generates Blender spline curves from the
text, which can be extruded to build full 3D meshes. Generating a "good looking" knot with
appropriate tension and curvature takes a bit of manual editing, but it is usually quick to do.

### Installing
[Download the package](https://github.com/johnhw/blender_knots/archive/0.1.zip)

* Open **Blender**. You'll need 2.70 or greater.
* Go to `File/User Preferences/Add Ons` and choose the `Install from File` button at the bottom. Find `blender_knots.py` from
the download and select it. Make sure you tick the `Development: Knot generator` tick box to enable it, then save the user settings.

The knot generator is now available in the `Create` tab in `Object` mode of the 3D view (below the buttons for the various
standard meshes). You need to have a text fragment with a knot description in it, which you will be able to select from
the panel to generate geometry from.

#### What's included
* `knot_plugin.py` The plugin itself
* `knot_blank.blend` An empty template scene which you can generate a standard knot from a text file
* `physics.blend` A simple example showing the use of physics to animate a knot tightening.

### UI
* `knot` select a text fragment (entered in the Blender text editor) to generate the knot from
* `scale` overall scale of the whole knot.
* `extrude` if enabled, this will turn on beveling for the knot. These options are provided to
generate a good looking knot quickly -- you can get exactly the same effect by turning on bevel and
adding the modifiers yourself.
    * `width` width of the beveling for the knot path
    * `smoothing steps` if non-zero will add a smoothing modifier
    * `subdivision` if non-zero will add a subdivision surface modifier
    
* `Over/Under z-shift` These control how the geometry should look where knot elements cross.
    * `depth` how much to move the rope going under over up/down where it crosses
    * `bias` whether the undergoing rope moves down (bias = 1), the overgoing rope goes up (bias=-1),
    or the undergoing rope goes down by 0.5 and the undergoing rope up by 0.5 (bias=0.5)
    
* `Make Knot` creates the geometry


### Editing
The curve can most easily be edited with *proportional editing* turned on and set to *Connected* which
will allow the vertices to be moved with some degree of continuity. The edit mode tool `Smooth` (in the 
Tools panel) can also be used to tweak the generated vertices to make them lie a bit more smoothly.

Note: if you want to separate ropes into different objects (e.g. to render ropes in different colours),
then select a rope in edit mode using `Select/Linked` and then use `Curve/Separate` to separate that rope
into a new object. This is best done after the knot is fully posed.

### Animating
Using curves has the nice property that the curves can be animated using the soft body physics to
simulate the knot movement. It's tricky to get realistic motion where the rope doesn't self intersect, but
it can be used in simple cases, and can be used to drape the rope over objects.

To control the movement of the rope, use Hooks to pull on the curve. The easiest way to set this is up
is to go to `edit mode` (TAB), select the vertex you want to drag, then `Curve/Control Points/Hooks/Hook to New Object` to 
create a new hook that can pull the rope. This will generate an Empty that
can be keyframed in the usual way to animate motion of the rope with physics turned on.
