# Experimental logging
I often deal with experimental trials in human-computer interaction: an experiment is set up where a user interacts with some software, performing a sequence of tasks, and the interactions are logged for later analysis. For example:

* clicking on a sequence of targets of different sizes and locations;
* reading a document with types of scrolling;
* driving a (simulated) car with different kinds of controllers;

and so on. 

There are lots of other experimental instruments that are used in these studies (questionnaires, video recording, interviews, etc.) but usually we also want to capture what happens inside the experimental software by writing out log files. These usually look something like this:

```
    log_user_1.csv
        Time,action,x,state
        20.4321,OK clicked,245,102
        10.330,Back pressed,100,19

    log_user_2.csv
        Time,action,x,state
        ...
```

This ought to be trivial. It doesn't seem to be.


# Parts


This series of posts discusses issues with logging and writing experimental software. It is divided into five sections:

* [Part I](part_i_guidance.md.html) contains general guidance about logging, including timestamping, log file formats and best practices. It is relevant for everyone logging data.
* [Part II](part_ii_logging_to_sqlite.md.html) suggests using `sqlite` databases as a robust way of logging experimental data, and discusses table structures and ways of managing database logs.
* [Part III]() TBC discusses how to structure state changes in experimental software (e.g. nested conditions) and some prototypical Python code to do this.
* [Part IV](part_iv_pseudonyms.md.html) is a mercifully short article on generating good (`BESUT-AGATA` style) pseudonyms for experimental participants.
* [Part V]() TBC illustrates a working experimental platform using `sqlite` logging, state machine management and robust pseudonyms.
