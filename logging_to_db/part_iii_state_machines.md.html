# States and state machines

Experiments are generally driven by a *state machine*, where state transitions move participants from one part of an experimental trial to another. In the very simplest experiments there are a fixed sequence of tasks that are executed one after the other, identically for all users. More complex experiments will have logical groupings of tasks (e.g. into conditions). Some of these task groupings will only be taken by some subsets of users. Some experiments will have conditional execution of subtasks (such as repeating a trial until a success criterion, or branching tasks depending on previous choices). An subtask might be ended by a user action, or a time out. The ordering of the (some) of the transitions is often shuffled between users or repetitions; for example, counterbalancing condition order to mitigate learning effects in a within-subjects study.

## Experiment states and paths
Experimental software needs to manage the transition between states. These nested state machines are well-represented by Harel's [statecharts](https://statecharts.dev/what-is-a-statechart.html), though drawing the statechart for an experiment is often much too complicated to be worthwhile to draw. It's easier just to implement the code.

### State machine example

These experiment states are typically hierarchically grouped and ordered. For example, imagine a Fitts' law style pointing task (testing how fast people can click on targets with a pointing device). We might have a grouped hierarchy of states:

* Two pointing devices: mouse with inertia (A) and mouse without inertia (B)
* Two types of task: static pointing, tracking moving objects
* Five levels of difficulty (in terms of target size/distance for static, target size/speed for tracking)
* Three repetitions of each target acquisition.
* In between each repetition there might be a cooldown and countdown phase

---

This might have some specific structure:

* Each user uses *either* the inertia or the without inertia pointing device (between groups)
* Each performs the task type (static, moving) in counterbalanced order. 
* Each pointing task ends when either the user enters the target *or* more than five seconds elapse. 
* We'd have some initial welcome and information screens, and a debriefing page at the very end. 
* Difficulty levels might be randomised with a task. 

This means that the states have an order or subset of valid states which has to be determined for each user. Most orderings are **select one** (e.g. with or without inertia) or a specific **permutation** (e.g. randomly shuffled difficulty). In more complex experiments, the order may only be known at run-time, e.g. if a more difficult task will only be presented if an easier task has already been completed.


#### Flow control
My suggestion is to write experimental software that is driven by the state machine, in an event driven fashion. So the structure looks something like:

********************************
*             +--------+
*             v        |
*    UI --> FSM --> system
*    ^               |
*    +---------------+       
******************************** 

The experimental software should otherwise be "stateless" -- so that jumping to state `/Stage:Main/Pointing:Inertia/Movement:Static/ID:5/Rep:1/Target:3/Phase:Cooldown` is a valid thing to do at any arbitrary point, as if it were a web browser jumping to a specific URL. The URL model can literally be implemented in simple cases, with a server or just a collection of static HTML with URLs like `/Stage_Main/Pointing_Inertia/Movement_Static/ID_5/Rep_1/Target_3/Phase_Cooldown.html`.


The main logic of the experiment can have an explicit "dispatch", like this:

```python
def dispatch(fsm):    
    while fsm.state != "COMPLETED":
        if fsm.state == "/intro":
            intro(context, ephemeral)
        if fsm.state.startswith("/main"):
            main_experiment(context, ephemeral)
        # etc.
        if fsm.state=="/debrief"
            debrief(context, ephemeral)        
```

This is easier to reason about than spreading state changes about the code (though code could still `jump` or `next` internally if required).



### Paths and state transition
* A path-like notation is useful to record which state the software is in: `/A/1/2/1` or even better `/Stage:Main/Pointing:Inertia/Movement:Static/ID:5/Rep:1/Target:3/Phase:Cooldown` 
* The path notation with `attr:value` style elements is particularly helpful when describing orderings or subsets; it can also be translated to/from a flat dictionary:
```python
    {
        "stage":"main",
        "pointing":"inertia",
        "movement":"static",
        "id":5,
        "rep":1,
        "target:3
        "phase":"cooldown"
    }
```
* Glob-notation is one way to refer to specific subsets, like `/Stage:*` or `/Stage:Main/Pointing:*/Movement:Static/**`

### Subsets
It is often necessary to control the specific path through a state machine. A basic operation is to set the subset of values for a given attribute:
- `fsm.subset("pointing", ["inertia"])` selecting just the inertia path
- `fsm.subset("pointing", ["inertia", "no_inertia"]).subset("movement", ["static", "dynamic"])` ordering the `pointing` and `movement` paths

Some convenience functions that just wrap `fsm.subset(attr, values)`:
- `fsm.select(attr, value)` subset attr to have just the value `value`
- `fsm.order(attr, values)` specify the specific order of values, validating that they are all present
- `fsm.shuffle(attr, rng)` shuffle the values for attr with the given random number generator
- `fsm.permute(attr, index)` select permutation `index` of the possible values (using the natural ordering of permutations)


### Finite state machines
* One useful model has state changes that come in two types:
    * `jump` where an activity jumps to a specific path
    * `next` when an activity finishes normally (or is aborted) and moves to a relative part of the hierarchy based on the ordering of states

* A sequence of the natural state change order needs to be created, usually for each trial, unless the ordering is completely fixed. 
    
* One way of representing these changes is to have functions to change state:    
    * `fsm.jump(reason, path)` jump immediately to the given absolute path, logging `reason` (a string) as the reason for the state change.        
    * `fsm.next(reason, levels=1)` when an activity finishes
        * `next("user clicked on target")`
        * `levels` allows `next` to optionally advance "up the hierarchy" e.g. to the next interface type or back to the start of a task.
            * `levels=-1` repeats the last "element"; `levels=1` advances normally,  `levels=0` does nothing, `levels=2` would skip to the start of the next node one level "up", `levels=-2` would repeat from one level up, etc.        
* `src/experiment_states.py` shows how this can be implemented in Python



## The machine

```python
class Machine:

    def __init__(self):
        self.context = {}        

    def init(self):

    def cold_start(self):

    def save(self):        

    def resume(self, query=None):        

    def shutdown(self, safe=False):        


```

The three parameters I've used are:
* `fsm` the state machine, as above
* `context` a dictionary of variables that represent the current context (like current user id, current trial id) that includes *everything that might need to be serialised to store the current state*.
* `ephemeral` a dictionary of variables (or any other data type) that represents values to carry around that can be reconstructed and/or shouldn't be persisted (like a network connection reference, database connection, or a file handle).

### Context variables
The `context` dictionary is used to represent the key state of the experiment. A `context` might look like:
```python
{
    "user_id":"BESUT-AGATA",
    "trial_id":7,
    "random_state":[...],
}
```

The experiment can then be `saved`, `loaded` or `inited`:

```python
def save_state(context, ephemeral):
    serialised_context = json.dumps(context)    
    ephemeral.db.execute("""INSERT INTO saves VALUES 
    (time, resume_state, user_id, trial_id) VALUES (?,?,?,?)""",
            get_time_string(), serialised_context, 
            context["user_id"], context["trial_id"])

def resume_state(ephemeral):
    result = ephemeral.db.execute("""SELECT resume_state FROM saves 
    ORDER BY rowid DESC LIMIT 1;""").fetchone()
    return json.loads(result)

def init_state(fsm_spec, resume=False, **kwargs):    
    ephemeral = init_ephemeral(**kwargs)
    if not resume:
        # cold start, we need to create both ephemeral and context
        context = init_context(**kwargs)
    else:
        context = resume_state(ephemeral)
    # attach the FSM, with a callback that "knows" the context and ephemeral
    # so has a database handle, etc.
    fsm = FSM(fsm_spec, pre_state_change = 
            lambda prev, new, reason:log_state(prev, new, reason, context, ephemeral))
    if context.current_state != fsm.state:
        fsm.jump(context.current_state, "Resumed state")
    # enable debug logging to database
    attach_debug_log(ephemeral.db)
    return context, ephemeral


def log_state(prev, new, reason, context, ephemeral):
    context.current_state = new
    ephemeral.db.execute("INSERT INTO states (time, prev, new, reason, trial_id) VALUES (?,?,?,?,?)",
            get_time_string(), prev, new, reason, context["trial_id"])

def init_context(user_id, trial_id, **kwargs):
    context = {"user_id":user_id, 
               "trial_id": ...}
    return context

def init_ephemeral(db_file, **kwargs):
    db_connection = sqlite3.connect(db_file)
    ephemeral = {"db":db_connection, ...}
```


### Example
Here's an skeleton example of how the Fitts' law experiment described might be configured and executed using `experiment_states.py`

```python
from experiment_states import FSM

x = State("intro") | 
    State("main") * (            
            State("inertia", ["on", "off"]) * 
            State("target", ["static", "dynamic"]) * 
            State("ID", 5) * State("repeat", 3) * 
            State("phase", ["countdown", "active", "cooldown"])
    )
    | State("debrief")    

def log_state_change(prev, new, reason):
    logger.state_change(prev, new, reason)

fsm = FSM(experiment_tree, pre_state=log_state_change)
fsm.select("inertia", "off")
fsm.order("target", "random")

print(fsm.state) # will be START

def show_intro(fsm):
    # pass    

fsm.jump("/intro", fn=show_intro) 
fsm.next(1)


def main_experiment(self):
    self.next(0) # jump to next valid state


```
